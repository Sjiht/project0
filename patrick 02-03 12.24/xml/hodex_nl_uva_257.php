Launching, developing, implementing, monitoring, evaluating and legitimating social policy and social projects are therefore important professional competencies these days.

The problems and opportunities presented by urban settings demand an increasingly broad mix of academic and professional skills. 

This Master's programme is the product of a unique collaboration between the University of Amsterdam (UvA) and the Amsterdam School of Social Work within the Hogeschool van Amsterdam (HvA). There is also increasing collaboration with universities and polytechnics in seven other European cities: Stockholm, Berlin, Antwerp, Madrid, Pecs, Zagreb and Ankara. This collaboration offers students the opportunity to study or conduct fieldwork abroad for a full or half semester as part of their Master.  ]]></programDescription><programDescription xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[What are the main social problems facing societies and policy makers?

-Poverty or social exclusion?
-Racism or failing integration of ethnic minorities?
-Urban violence and addiction or a failing police force in crime-ridden neighbourhoods?
- Teenage pregnancies and school drop outs or failing education, youth support and healthcare?
- Dysfunctional welfare institutions or the demise of the family and social networks?
-Rising mental illness or a society gripped by a 'therapy culture'?

Social Problems and Social Policy offers students an insight into the ways in which social problems are defined and tackled within welfare states, analysing the roles ascribed to citizens, professionals and other stakeholders within these processes. It considers the recent histories of various policy approaches and puts these in a comparative European context.

The programme primarily focuses on social problems as perceived within modern European welfare states. It compares the way social problems are constructed within the public spheres of various countries and analyses the emerging tensions within policy issues such as citizenship, the labour market and care for vulnerable groups.]]></programDescription><programName xml:lang="nl"><![CDATA[Sociology: Social Problems and Social Policy]]></programName><programName xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[Sociology:
