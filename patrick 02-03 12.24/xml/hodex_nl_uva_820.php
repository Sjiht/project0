Those infected with AIDS become stigmatised, and associated with the breakdown of community morals. Contextualizing AIDS in everyday life, we will work to understand how people live and die with AIDS.

This programme provides an overview of the latest developments in the anthropology of AIDS, promotes understanding and analysis in a broad social, political and economic context, and explores combining qualitative and quantitative methods for studying HIV/AIDS. Students apply these insights to case studies that highlight the complexity of AIDS and reflect on the way anthropological research can inform interventions intended to combat AIDS.

AIDS will be placed in a historical perspective, paying attention to recent shifts toward the provision of anti-retroviral treatment. While the disease and efforts to combat it have been flourishing for more than 20 years, there is little ground for examination of past successes or failures, or comparison with other public health efforts.]]></programDescription><programDescription xml:lang="nl"><![CDATA[At the crossroads of sexuality and death, AIDS is a potent metaphor for inequality, the failures of modernity, and the rise of globalisation in many communities.

Those infected with AIDS often become stigmatised, and associated with the breakdown of community morals. This paradox, where the individual as well as structural political and economic factors are blamed for the spread of a disease, creates ample opportunities for studying the meanings and causes people assign to illness and disease. By contextualizing AIDS in peoples everyday lives, we will work to understand how people live and die with AIDS, and how they create meaning when confronted with these issues.

This programme provides an overview of the latest developments in the anthropology of AIDS, to promote the understanding and analysis of AIDS in a broad social, political and economic context, and to explore possibilities for combining qualitative and quantitative methods for studying HIV/AIDS. Students will apply these insights to contemporary case studies that highlight the complexity of AIDS and, further, to reflect on the way anthropological research can inform interventions intended to combat AIDS. ]]></programDescription><programName xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[Aids in the 21st Century: A Medical Anthropological Perspective]]></programName><programName xml:lang="nl"><![CDATA[Aids in the 21st Century: A Medical Anthropological Perspective]]></programName><programSummary xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[This module provides an overview of the anthropology of AIDS, promotes understanding and analysis in a broad social, political and economic context, and explores qualitative and quantitative methods.]]></programSummary><programSummary xml:lang="nl"><![CDATA[This course is an intensive, two-week programme designed to offer students insight into the latest social research on HIV/AIDS.
