What is the role of culture in the application of such Acts in conflict and post-conflict situations around the world, including the Netherlands? How does intervention and prevention relate to survivors' perceptions? Caregivers and scientists are confronted with human rights, abroad and at home, when working in an asylum or a psycho-trauma center, in humanitarian NGO's such as AI and MSF, or in fieldwork and research. Power struggles generate human calamities. 

Connections between health and human rights are often made by emphasizing universal values, while being reluctant to attach importance to the underlying social and cultural dynamics. In medical anthropology, this global and universal discourse is seen as problematic. Human Rights Acts are all too often rights that do not act. What are the reasons for that? The anthropological argument is that respect and righteousness presuppose an in-depth knowledge of what is at stake for the victims, perpetrators, politicians, bystanders, lawyers and doctors. ]]></programDescription><programDescription xml:lang="nl"><![CDATA[Human rights law provides standards for medical care for victims of, for instance, war and torture. What is the role of culture in the application of such law in conflict and post-conflict situations around the world? How should one connect intervention and prevention to survivors' perceptions?
Human rights acts and treaties all too often neither act nor treat. Why is that? The anthropological argument is that respect and righteousness presuppose an in-depth knowledge of what is at stake for the victims, perpetrators, politicians, bystanders, lawyers and doctors. What do human rights and wrongs mean to these stakeholders? How do victims deal with their suffering if on their own? This course offers students a multi-disciplinary perspective on a variety of issues in the field of medicine and human rights. We will discuss experiences of human rights abuses in different cultures and 'the righteousness of medical care' in situations of conflict and reconciliation, asylum and extradition. Caregivers and scientists are confronted with human rights, abroad and at home, when working in an asylum or a psycho-trauma centre, in humanitarian NGO's, or in fieldwork and research.
