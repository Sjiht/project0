It focuses on all the main regions of Asia, stressing the importance of looking at interconnections both within the vast Asian region and between Asian societies and other parts of the world, especially Europe. The crucial importance of Asia for current and future social science theory is demonstrated throughout the programme.

Amsterdam has always been a meeting point of cultures and a site of international trade and intellectual exchange. As such, the growing influence of Asian cultures in Western Europe in general, and in the Netherlands in particular, is clearly visible in the city's changing urban face. 

The UvA is a vibrant centre for education and research in the area of Asian Studies. The Asian Studies in Amsterdam (AsiA) network is a collaboration between the University of Amsterdam and the International Institute for Asian Studies (IIAS). In recent years, UvA researchers have received prestigious external grants from funding bodies including the NWO (Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research) to conduct projects in Asian Studies.]]></programDescription><programDescription xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[Contemporary Asian Studies is an innovative programme with a broad, interdisciplinary character and comparative approach.

The crucial importance of Asia for current and future social science theory is demonstrated throughout the programme.

This programme offers courses that focus on contemporary themes as well as courses on specific regions of Asia. The courses provide training in critical approaches to the social sciences and address issues related to identity politics, migration, development, power and culture in Asia today. The programme also offers students the opportunity to design and conduct an independent field research in Asia, leading to the Master's thesis. Students wishing to conduct research on Asia from the Netherlands can also be accommodated.
