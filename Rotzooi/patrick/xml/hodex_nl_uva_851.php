The Master's programme in Anthropology at the UvA is designed to help students search for answers to this question. It is especially well-suited for students interested in the interplay between anthropological theory and ethnographic practice.

The Master's programme in Anthropology is a year of intense and serious study, but also a great challenge. The independent nature of the activities you engage in during the year helps you develop your independence and expertise as an anthropologist.

The standards of this Master's programme are rigorous and students are expected to demonstrate a high level of commitment, independence and resilience. You complete your Master's degree by taking part in an MA anthropology conference, in which students present the main points of their theses to the public.
