Applicants are expected to have a solid basis in the field of urban studies of at least (an equivalent of) 30 ECTS credits earned during previous study.

Those applicants who hold a higher professional Bachelor's degree obtained at a university of applied sciences (HBO) will first need to complete a relevant academic Bachelor's degree before applying to the Master's programme. Completion of a relevant Bachelor's degree however, does not automatically lead to admission. Selection tends to be highly competitive reflecting the number and quality of applications received for each selection round.]]></requirementDescription><requirementDescription xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[The Research Master's Programme in Urban Studies seeks students with an academic Bachelor's degree (or equivalent) in a discipline closely related to the programme, such as human geography, urban and regional planning and political science.

The MSc in Metropolitan Studies deals with the complex reality of urban centres. Students of the programme have the opportunity to develop their own nationally comparative, fieldwork-based research projects in the field. The curriculum includes study abroad, which is central to its internationally comparative approach.  

The programme makes full use of its location in the thriving metropolis of Amsterdam through organising excursions to projects and neighbourhoods in the city and other Dutch urban centres, which are intended to acquaint students with urban praxis in the Netherlands. Student exchange agreements with foreign universities offer students the opportunity to study in cities such as New York, London and Berlin and to become familiar with other university cultures and city life in other countries. The programme has strong ties with the Amsterdam institute for Metropolitan and International Development Studies (AMIDSt). ]]></programDescription><programDescription xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[What are the consequences of this urban growth and change for urban societies?
Are integration, segregation and polarisation increasingly problematic?
How can we plan and manage this urban growth and change locally and regionally?
What does the shift from 'government' to 'governance' mean for the urban and regional planning process?

These are some of the many questions and challenges we discuss in our Research Master Urban Studies.

Our programme combines the disciplines of urban geography, economic geography, urban and regional planning, and urban sociology, providing a multidisciplinary and comprehensive approach to urban change. An important theme throughout the programme is the international comparison of urban phenomena. Thematic courses are combined with advanced research methodology courses, a stay abroad and research projects under supervision of leading experts in urban studies. Students will acquire sound theoretical and methodological knowledge and the research skills to start a career in the social sciences, or to work in relevant policy fields like housing, planning or social policy, or in related commercial sectors like real estate or property development.]]></programDescription><programName xml:lang="nl"><![CDATA[Urban Studies (research
