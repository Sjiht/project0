The core courses focus on the theoretical framework, research subjects for Medical and Social Anthropologists and the research design. Students also take one elective course on a theme or in an area that relates to their research interests. The programme is completed with a fieldwork of 8- 10 weeks and a thesis in the second semester.

-acquainted themselves with social science theories and research practices that can be applied to the interface between health, society and culture
-the ability to analyse practical health problems, formulate relevant objectives for Social Science research and compose research proposals
-the skills they need to execute such research and report on it according to the applicable standards.]]></contentSummary><contentType>website</contentType><subject>job perspective</subject><webLink xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[http://studieadres.nl]]></webLink></contentLink><programDescription xml:lang="nl"><![CDATA[Medical anthropologists and sociologists study health, illness, and healing from a broad, interdisciplinary perspective. Their research both addresses theoretical problems in the social sciences, and contributes to applied and policy issues in health care. They study the meanings of illness experiences, the socioeconomic factors shaping health and suffering, and the cultural dimensions of healing practices.  

The programme in Medical Anthropology and Sociology is an intensive one-year Master's degree combining coursework and a thesis project based on fieldwork. It equips students with skills to undertake individually designed research projects, trains them in social science theory and methods, and gives them a critical understanding of health challenges in a globalised and multicultural world.]]></programDescription><programDescription xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[The Master in Medical Anthropology and Sociology trains students to understand health, disease and the body from a social science perspective. The programme looks at pressing health problems as well as key debates in social science theory. We emphasise an interpretive and critical approach. Gender, or ethnicity for example, are not just variables whose effects on health can be measured; they are also categories made by societies, and lived by consumers and patients. Students examine a broad range of issues: from the social determinants of disease to the role of biomedicine as a powerful institution in modern life.  

The programme has a special focus on research. Students design and carry out their own original research based on fieldwork in the Netherlands or abroad. They are supervised by an international staff with a range of theoretical expertise and research experience from projects carried out in many areas of the world. There are also opportunities to link the thesis to staff research projects or health interventions.

For students interested in this field of study, we also offer a two-year Research Master's.
