This programme takes a look at a variety of cultural phenomena from a sociological perspective. 

Cultural Sociology trains students at a high academic level. It provides students with thorough knowledge of sociological concepts and theories with respect to culture in the broad sense.  Students will gain knowledge of aspects of European cultural history in relation to social processes and insight into the functioning of cultural policy areas. Cultural Sociology students will gain the ability to use these concepts and theories in creative ways. The combination of empirical studies with theoretical reflection gives students the intellectual tools and skills they need to analyse and understand complex social and cultural issues. ]]></programDescription><programDescription xml:lang="nl"><![CDATA[Cultural Sociology deals with the study of culture both in the broad sense (lifestyles, mentalities, value orientations) and in the more specific sense of referring to cultural fields like the arts, popular music, and organized religion. Culture is approached sociologically as rooted in, emerging from and impacting on social (economic, political) relations and group processes. Moreover, culture is conceived in dynamic terms, and viewed in the context of social changes.
