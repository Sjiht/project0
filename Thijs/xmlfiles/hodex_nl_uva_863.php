The programme looks at economic growth strategies, social inequalities and the ways of dealing with these inequalities in both rural and urban contexts. New participatory governance networks at local and national levels are among the strategies which are explored. Both environmental and social issues are included in the programme within the broader context of the strong urbanisation processes currently in the global South. Prime issues in the programme are natural resources and the management needed to provide them for growing populations.

The Master's programme in International Development Studies provides students with a thorough background in contemporary theories and debates on international development, as well as more specific insights into key themes within the international development sector.

A characteristic feature of this Master's programme is a fieldwork period of roughly 8-10 weeks in a developing country.

For students interested in this field of study, we also offer a two-year Research Master's.]]></programDescription><programDescription xml:lang="nl"><![CDATA[International Development Studies focuses on the strategies countries in the global South are integrating into a globalizing world.
