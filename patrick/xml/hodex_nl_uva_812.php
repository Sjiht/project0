The Summer Institute on Sexuality, Culture and Society is an intensive four-week summer course, which focuses on the study of sexuality across cultures and is taught by an international faculty team. It has become an annual high spot for all those engaged in the serious discussion of sexuality in a broad social context.

The aim of the course is to explore and study the social and cultural dimensions of human sexuality and gain training in areas of sexuality research - both theory and method - not commonly available in other institutions.
