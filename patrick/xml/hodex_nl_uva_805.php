They are characterized by a sizable and heterogeneous population, but also by the fact that social relations show higher levels of anonymity and that social problems and contrasts are more tangible than elsewhere. 
The spatial and social mobility of the urban population, the rise and fall of lifestyles and subcultures, and changing social relations between individuals and groups in urban settings become matters of serious political concern and so subjects of social scientific investigation. Cities are unique laboratories, a plethora of people, lifestyles and forms of human behavior can be seen. 

Urban sociologists are interested, for instance, in how urbanites deal with public and private domains. They are also interested in how the fate of a diverse population is shaped by the institutional make-up of the city, and how they leave their mark on the urban environment. 
]]></programDescription><programDescription xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[Urban Sociology students study the tensions between the public space and the private domain, and the ways local governments try to control these tensions. Urban Sociology deals with the history of cities, particularly the way in which the built environment, but also the social, political and economic environments, formed its specific structures over the course of time and how this impacted on city dwellers' everyday lives, and—vice versa—how city dwellers leave their mark on these structures.

Urban Sociology provides students with thorough knowledge of urban processes and forms, by studying key work studies and theories in urban sociology and related disciplines. Students will learn to identify the unique set of processes found in world cities that result in new patterns of inequality and how governments in Europe and North America have devised new strategies and techniques to regulate these inequalities.]]></programDescription><programName xml:lang="nl"><![CDATA[Sociology: Urban Sociology]]></programName><programName xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[Sociology: Urban Sociology]]></programName><programSummary xml:lang="nl"><![CDATA[Urban Sociology is characterized by highly specific approaches, focusing on (qualitative) sociological-historical research and ethnography.
